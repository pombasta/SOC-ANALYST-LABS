## 🧠 Lab Overview

This lab simulates the role of a SOC Analyst receiving and investigating a security alert.
The objective is to analyze the alert, determine its severity, and decide whether it represents a true security incident or a false positive.

---

## 🎯 Objective

- Understand the alert triage process
- Analyze alert details
- Decide if the alert is a True Positive or False Positive
- Practice SOC-level decision making

---

## 🚨 Alert Information

- Alert Type: Suspicious Login Activity
- Source: SIEM
- Severity: Medium
- Description:
  Multiple failed login attempts followed by a successful login from the same IP address.

---

## 🔍 Investigation Steps

1. Reviewed alert details provided by the SIEM
2. Checked the number of failed login attempts
3. Analyzed the source IP address
4. Reviewed login success timing
5. Assessed user behavior patterns

---

## 📊 Analysis

- Multiple failed login attempts may indicate brute-force activity
- Successful login after failures increases suspicion
- No previous history of suspicious activity from the user
- IP address was not flagged as malicious

---

## ✅ Verdict

- Classification: **Suspicious Activity**
- Status: **False Positive**
- Reason:
  The activity was consistent with a user mistyping credentials before successfully logging in.

---

## 🛡️ SOC Response

- Close alert with documentation
- No escalation required
- Continue monitoring for repeated behavior

---

## 🧬 MITRE ATT&CK Mapping

- Technique: T1110 – Brute Force
- Tactic: Credential Access

---

## 📚 Key Takeaways

- Not all suspicious alerts are incidents
- Context is critical in alert triage
- Proper documentation is essential for SOC operations
